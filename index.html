                <div class="half-with">
                    <p>exas has a long-standing rivalry with the University of Oklahoma. The
                        between the
                        University of Texas and Oklahoma is commonly known as the "Red River Rivalry" and is held
                        annually in Dallas at the Cotton Bowl. Dallas is used as a "neutral site" since it is
                        approximately midway between the two campuses. The stadium is split, with each team having
                        an
                        equal number of supporters on each side of the 50 yard line. Texas state flags fly around
                        the
                        Longhorn end of the stadium and Oklahoma state flags fly around the Sooner end. This border
                        rivalry is often considered to be one of the top five current rivalries in the NCAA. The Red
                        River Shootout originated in 1900, while Oklahoma was still a territory of the United
                        States,
                        and it is the longest-running college-football rivalry played on a neutral field
                        Due to the number of large stadia required for the Olympic tournament, venues in distant cities
                        – often more than 200 km (120 mi) away from the main host – are typically used for the football
                        tournament. In an extreme example, two early-round venues for the 1984 Games were on the East
                        Coast of the United States, well over 2,000 miles (3,200 km) from the host city of Los Angeles.
                        The next Games held in the United States, the 1996 Games, were unique in that no matches were
                        held in the host city of Atlanta; the nearest venue and the site of the finals was 65 miles (105
                        km) away on the University of Georgia campus in Athens. Counting the 2012 and 2016 Summer
                        Olympics, there are 121 venues that have hosted Olympic football, the most of any sport.s

                    <p>Football at the Summer Olympics has been included in every Summer Olympic Games as a men's
                        competition sport, except 1896 and 1932. Women's football was added to the official program at
                        the 1996 Atlanta Games.Associations affiliated with FIFA may send teams to participate in the
                        tournament. There are no age restrictions on women's teams, while men's teams are restricted to
                        under-24 players (born on or after 1 January 1997) with a maximum of three overage players
                        allowed.[3] The men's tournament is typically restricted to under-23 players, though following
                        the postponement of the Olympics by a year, FIFA decided to maintain the restriction of players
                        born on or after 1 January 1997.[4] In June 2020, FIFA approved the use of the video assistant
                        referee (VAR) system at the Olympics.[50</p>
